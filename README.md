# Canadian home journal

The Canadian Home Journal was a periodical published from 1910 to 1958. It likely covered a variety of topics relevant to Canadian homes and lifestyles during that time. The journal probably included articles on home design, gardening, recipes, family life, and DIY projects, reflecting the interests and needs of Canadian families in the early to mid-20th century. Given its publication period, the journal would have captured the changing dynamics of Canadian society, including post-war developments, shifts in family structures, and evolving domestic roles. The target audience was likely homeowners, homemakers, and families interested in improving their living spaces and lifestyles.
